INTRODUCTION TO Background Tasks

- background processes allow the main application to continue to do the main/most important tasks

- allows workers to execute tasks in background
    - tasks are sent to queue, and workers execute and free themselves up afterwards


NOTE: CELERY DOES NOT SUPPORT WINDOWS


MESSAGE BROKERS

- message brokers are also required
    - they relay message between Django application and Celery workers

    -types of brokers
        Redis(in-memory data store)
        RabbitMQ(real, enterprise-grade broker) - more powerful, but also more complex

- using redis for this course - will also be used for Caching
    - easy to start using


INSTALLING REDIS

- best way to install is using docker

    # syntax: -d(detached -meaing background), -p(to specify port mapping), localhost:docker container
    docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis

- redis will be run inside a docker container
    - a single process on computer - contains a virtual environment for redis
    - localhost will port will be mapped to port on the docker container

docker ps

- docker container is running - below console output:

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                    NAMES
