Each function in Django is associated with an app

All of the apps can be bundled into a single app to allow easy sharing and management

Avoid bloating apps, which will become monoliths

Bad Organization:
    products: product, collection, tag
    customers: customer
    carts: cart, cartitem
    orders: order, orderitem

Above is bad, because of dependencies between the different apps
    - additionally, updates to one app may require changes to another
    - cart is useless without a product catalog or the ability to place an order
    - these are highly related functions which should be bundled together

Monolith is still not required, look for middle ground

Better Organization

Store: Product, Collection, Customer, Cart, CartItem, Order, OrderItem

Tags: Tag, TaggedItem
